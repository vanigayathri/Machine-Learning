K-nearest neighbors (KNN) is a straightforward and versatile machine learning algorithm categorized as an instance-based or lazy learning method. Operating without explicit training, KNN makes predictions by considering the majority class or average of the k-nearest data points in the feature space. The algorithm relies on a distance metric, typically Euclidean distance, to measure similarity between data points. The choice of the hyperparameter 'k,' representing the number of neighbors considered during prediction, significantly impacts KNN's performance and is often determined through cross-validation. While applicable to both classification and regression tasks, KNN's suitability extends to various domains, including pattern recognition, recommendation systems, and anomaly detection.
