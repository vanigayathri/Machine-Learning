Logistic regression is a widely-used statistical model and a fundamental algorithm in machine learning, specifically designed for binary classification tasks. It predicts the probability that an instance belongs to a particular class by applying the logistic function to a linear combination of input features. Unlike linear regression, logistic regression uses a logistic or sigmoid function to squash the output into the range [0, 1], making it suitable for modeling probabilities. The model is trained through maximum likelihood estimation, adjusting weights to maximize the likelihood of the observed class labels. Logistic regression is interpretable, computationally efficient, and commonly employed in areas such as medical diagnosis, finance, and marketing for its simplicity and effectiveness.
